% This is an example about the 3D full waveform location method
% used to invert a known explosive source - the Non 
% Proliferation Experiment at the Nevada Test Site in year 1993.

1. Analysemisfit.m
% It shows how to locate the best solution 
% and estimate the uncertainty using the misfit of P and P coda 
% waves (Figure 5b in Wang et al. (2019)) in the 3D grid search % region 

2. Plotmisfit.m
% It shows how to make the contour plots 
% (Figure 5b in Wang et al. (2019)) based on the misfit of P and % P coda waves in the 3D grid search region
